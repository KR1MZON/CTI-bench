While often lacking much functionality as independent malware, they have one crucial task: to load and execute additional malicious payloads.\\n\\nHUI Loader is a custom DLL loader that can be deployed by hijacked legitimate software programs susceptible to DLL search order hijacking. Once executed, the loader will then deploy and decrypt a file containing the main malware payload.\\n\\nIn the past, HUI Loader was used in campaigns by groups including APT10/Bronze Riverside – connected to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS) – and Blue Termite. The groups have deployed remote access trojans (RATs) including SodaMaster, PlugX, and QuasarRAT in previous campaigns.\\n\\nNow, it appears that the loader has been adapted to spread ransomware.\"\\n\"According to Secureworks\\' Counter Threat Unit (CTU) research team, two activity clusters related to HUI Loader have been connected to Chinese-speaking threat actors, namely Bronze Riverside and Bronze Starlight.\"\\n\"',\n",
